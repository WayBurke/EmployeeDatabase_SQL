# MODULE 9 CHALLENGE - SQL Challenge: Data Modeling, Data Engineering and Data Analysis

## Description

### Part I: EmployeeSQL
This portion of the challenge is broken down into 3 sections: 
* Data Modeling - Based on the structure of the CSV files in the 'data' folder, an ERD sketch was created using QuickDBD
* Data Engineering - From the sketched ERD, a schema was generated by QuickDBD that was altered to my preference in schema creation. The CSV files were then imported into the tables created.
* Data Analysis - Queries responses were provided for all 8 questions.


### Part II: Bonus
This notebook used the database created in Part I - EmployeeSQL to 
* Create a connection using SQLAlchemy
* Create a histogram of the employee salary ranges and
* Create a bar chart of the average salaries per job title
