# Employee Database Assessment
**Conducting Data Modeling, Data Engineering, and Data Analysis using SQL and Pandas**

## Overview
The objective of this project is to perform a research analysis of employees hired during the 1980s and 1990s at Pewlett Hackard (a fictional company). All that remains of the employee database from that period are six CSV files. Those six CSV files will be used to design tables which will be then imported into a SQL Database so that the research assessment can be conducted.

## The Research
The research is broken down into 3 sections: Data Modeling, Data Engineering, and Data Analysis with a bonus assessment done using SQLAlchemy. Following is a breakdown of each of those sections.

### Data Modeling
Based on the structure of the CSV files in the 'data' folder, an ERD sketch was created using QuickDBD.

### Data Engineering
From the sketched ERD, a schema was generated by QuickDBD that was altered to my preference in schema creation. The CSV files were then imported into the tables created. The modified SQL schema can be view at this [link](https://github.com/WayBurke/EmployeeDatabase_SQL/blob/main/EmployeeSQL/EmployeeSQL_Schema_QuickDBD.sql).

### Data Analysis
Queries responses were provided for the 8 questions below. The SQL queries can be viewed [here](https://github.com/WayBurke/EmployeeDatabase_SQL/blob/main/EmployeeSQL/EmployeeSQL%20-%20SelectStatements.sql).

The questions are as follows:
  1. List the following details of each employee: employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary.
  2. List the following details of employees who were hired in 1986: first name, last name, and hire date.
  3. List the manager of each department along with their department number, department name, the manager's employee number, last name, and first name.
  4. List the department number of each employee along with that employee's employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
  5. List all employees whose first name is "Hercules" and whose last names begins with the letter "B."
  6. List all employees in the Sales department, including their employee number, last name, and first name.
  7. List all employees in the Sales and Development departments, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
  8. List the frequency count, in descending order, of all the employee by last names, i.e., how many employees share each last name.


#### Bonus Analysis using Jupyter Notebook
This [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/WayBurke/EmployeeDatabase_SQL/blob/main/EmployeeSQL/EmployeeSQL.ipynb) used the database created in Data Engineering phase to 
* Create a connection using SQLAlchemy
* Create a histogram of the employee salary ranges

* Create a bar chart of the average salaries per job title
